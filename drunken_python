# Python got drunk and the built-in functions str() and int() are 
# acting odd:
# str(4)   -> 4
# str("4") -> 4
# int("4") -> "4"
# int(4)   -> "4"

# You need to create two functions to substitute str() and int().
# A function called int_to_str() that converts integers into 
# strings and a function called str_to_int() that converts strings
# into integers. 

def int_to_str(num):
    return str(num)

def str_to_int(num):
    return int(num)
    
# I... don't understand. Playing around with the code gave me the
# correct answer below, but it seems opposite of my understanding
# of what these functions were supposed to do

def int_to_str(num):
    return int(num)

def str_to_int(num):
    return str(num)
